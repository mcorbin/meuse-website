## Roadmap (08/12/2019)

This is what I plan to do:

- More refactoring: there are several things that I don't like in the codebase (especially how tests are written).
- Better logs.
- Better documentation (in the code and in the documentation website).
- A CLI.
- A better frontend (more features, authentication etc...)
