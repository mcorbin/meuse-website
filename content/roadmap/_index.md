## Roadmap (30/07/2019)

This is what I plan to do

- More logs and metrics (probably a prometheus endpoint)
- HTTPS support for the HTTP server.
- TLS support for the PostgreSQL client.
- A tool to automatically import crates from `crates.io`, and maybe mirror `crates.io` in Meuse.
- A CLI.
- Store crates binary files on s3-compatible backends
