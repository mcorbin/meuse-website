## Roadmap (11/11/2019)

This is what I plan to do

- More refactoring: there are several things that I don't like in the codebase.
- New features around `crates.io` mirroring.
- More metrics (especially for the S3 client).
- Better documentation (in the code and in the documentation website).
- A CLI.
- A read-only frontend.
