# Meuse, a free private Rust Registry

Meuse is a registry implementation for the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming language.

It implements the [alternative registries](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2141-alternative-registries.md) RFC and also exposes an API to manage users, tokens and categories.

Meuse is currently in alpha, and is not ready for production use. Things will break !
